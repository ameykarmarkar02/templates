### Current Tasks (Provide sufficient detail)
  * #1: Task 1:
        Prepare List of Questions to ask client at Client Info Session in order to obtain all the information necessary and understand the requirements before beginning to code the product.
        I added three important questions - the main one being whether to use Machine Learning in the code implementation.
  * #2: Task 2
        Complete the word chain exercise to ensure that all group members are able to work together and contribute equally to the project. I reviewed pull requests, checked that the testing is working:
        that is all tests are passing.
  * #3: Task 3
        Discussed general requirements of the project with the other team members

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Eveything is going smootly as planned. This could be because the taks designed for week-1 are simple and just created to ensure that the team is able to work smootly together. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Get information from client on product requirements
  * Determine Tech Stack to be used for the project
  * Start planning out the details of code implementation for the project
